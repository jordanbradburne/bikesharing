# bikesharing

## Overview
A key to the magic of NYC are the bikerides, and more specifically, citibike. Biking allows tourists to really get to know the area as well as get to know the people native to the area. This sparks the question: why not create a similar ride share buisness in more locations? How about start with Des Moines Iowa as the example?

The goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then create a set of visualizations to:
1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, add the new visualizations to the two created in this module for the final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Deliverables

1. Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format.
2. Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis.
3. Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation.

## Results: 
The results with visualizations as well as the results of each can be found using this link below:

* There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August.
* From the total trips 1,900,359 users subscribe to the company and 443,865 users are customers.
* The number of bikes checked out by duration for all users is usually between 0-60min.
*  Males have been the most reported to take the most bike trips.
* Peak hours are the same for male and female riders.
* In August, the peak day and time is on Thursday between 5 and 7pm.
* Whether you are a male or female, the most reported bikerides over all are on Thursday from Suscribers.

## Summary: 
Interestingly enough, Thursday is the most popular day to take a bike ride. Our customer should start the bikeshare business honestly multiple different cities because whether people are biking to work or casually, there will always be many consumers. There is enough evidence to convince the customer to invest in this, even though there is only one month of data, because of the visulizations that can further back the claim. It would be smart, though, to look at each month, especially the colder ones in the city, to see how many riders there would be so that the customer can prepare for those months. Another additional visualization that would be important to perform is the average distance between customers home location and the bike renting location. This would allow the customer to adjust for potential biker locations.
